# PEPE MANUSCRIPT V2

Once upon a time, in the wild and wacky world of the internet, a group of meme enthusiasts stumbled upon an idea so ridiculous, so utterly absurd, that they just had to make it a reality. And thus, $PEPEMS was born.  But who are we, you ask? Well, we're not your average crypto wizards or blockchain gurus. No, we're more like a bunch of meme-loving misfits with a penchant for chaos and a knack for turning dreams into memes... I mean reality.  Our journey began with a simple question: \"What if we could create a token that pays homage to the most legendary meme of all time?\" And thus, the idea for $PEPEMS was hatched - a token so meme-tastic, it'll make your head spin faster than a Pepe in a meme blender.  But $PEPEMS is more than just a token; it's a way of life. It's about embracing the absurdity of the internet, celebrating the joy of memes, and spreading laughter to all who dare to join us on this wild ride.  So if you're ready to dive headfirst into the meme-iverse, buckle up, my friends. Because with $PEPEMS, you never know what kind of meme madness awaits around the corner. And remember, in the world of memes, anything is possible... even financial freedom!

## Address Validation into 'Strict' List:
`If I'm trying to trade this token from this project, am I looking at the right one?`

The true identity of a token is its mint address. Scammers often try to impersonate a token by imitating metadata such as its name and logo. 

To help users stay safe from fake tokens, we provide a 'Strict' list with a trusted set of addresses and metadata from the original project team.
